 I’ve developed a Student Marks Calculator using object-oriented programming in Java.
✔️ Input subject-wise marks
✔️ Calculates total, average & grade
✔️ Validates inputs and formats a complete student report

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of classes, arrays, and user input handling in Java.
